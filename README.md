# Microsoft Hacks

If this is your first hackathon or your thirty-first, if you're just getting started writing code or have deployed multiple projects, or anywhere in between, we have resources to help you get started! Choose your path - [localhost](./localhost.md) or [cloud](./cloud.md)

| [localhost](./localhost.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [cloud](./cloud.md)               |

| The best place to start writing code is on your own system - localhost! If you're new to development, or looking to add on new languages or frameworks, this is the best place to start. We have a set of resources available to help you get started in creating your first project or even your first line of code! | If you're comfortable writing code and using frameworks, it's time to branch out to the cloud. You can deploy your projects, incorporate AI and ML, create chat bots, and manage databases. Microsoft Azure is a full-service cloud, meaning you have access to a entire suite of available services and functionality. |

## Workshops

During a hackathon you learn by building something with it. We've taken that concept and turned it into 4 [workshops](./workshops.md), each covering a different scenario and technology. The workshops will present you with a series of goals to achieve, during which you'll build out a solution. You can use the project you create and use it as the foundation for your project during the event! Check out the available [workshops](./workshops.md) and start hacking!

## Getting started

Every hacker needs a toolkit. Here's the three great tools to get you started:

### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is the most popular code editor. Lightweight and flexible, Code can be used with almost any programming language and project type, from [Python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) to [C#](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/dotnet), [web dev](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/working-with-javascript) to [data science and machine learning](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/overview). There's also a [full suite of extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) available to further enhance your development.

### Azure for Students

Microsoft Azure offers a host of cloud-based services and functionality. You can add [artificial intelligence](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/what-are-cognitive-services?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa) to your projects or build your own [machine learning solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-machine-learning-studio?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa). You can [host websites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa) and create [IoT projects](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-fundamentals/iot-introduction?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa).

If you are a college student, you can sign up for $100 in free credit with [Azure for Students](https://aka.ms/a4s)!

### Microsoft Learn

A hackathon is a great time to learn new frameworks and skills. Maybe it's a new framework like [React](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/react?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa) or [Django](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/django-create-data-driven-websites?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa), or a language like [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/csharp-first-steps?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa), [Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/python-first-steps?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa) or [TypeScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa). [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa) has a full collection of courses available to you to help you improve your skills.

## Take it to the next level

- [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa) is a community of university students around the world with an interest in technology.
